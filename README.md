# Ambulance-Dispatch-System
Efficient ambulance dispatch is crucial for timely medical assistance, particularly during emergency situations. Traditional dispatch methods often fall short in deploying optimization techniques, leading to operational delays and in- efficiencies. This project addresses these challenges by proposing an optimized system harnessed by Python programming. The primary objective revolves around enhancing healthcare provisions by minimizing the dispatcherâ€™s workload, curbing potential errors by the dispatcher and also in reduction of vehicle emissions using optimized routing. Further, timely arrival of ambulances significantly contributes to mitigating mortality rates in emergency situations.
